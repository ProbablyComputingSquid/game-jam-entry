# Red, White, and Beans #
A simple wave-based endless hack-and-slash made with kaboom for the [official joshco game jam](https://itch.io/jam/joshco-game-jam).
I couldn't afford to host it somewhere, so sadly, you have to run it locally. 

## How to Run ##
## New! Run in the browser! ##
1. Go to this repository's github page [here](https://github.com/ProbablyComputingSquid/game-jam-entry)
2. That's it! You can now play the game in your browser with no setup needed!
## Running locally ##
1. Clone the repository into your favorite IDE (I personally use WebStorm)
2. run `npm install` in the terminal so you get all your dependencies installed
3. run `node run.js` in the terminal to start the server
4. Open your browser and go to `localhost:8000`
5. Enjoy the game!
6. Vote for my project (optional, but it really helps!)


## Theme: "Self-Augmentation" ## 

The theme for this game jam was self-augmentation. According to merriam-webster, the definition of augmentation is: "to make greater, more numerous, larger, or more intense". 
To stick with that theme, I built a little hack-and-slash game with upgrades using kaboomjs. 

## gameplay ##

- Use the `WASD` to move around, and click to attack. 
- Press `TAB` to switch between sword and shotgun. 
- Collect coins to upgrade your weapons and health. 
- Press `E` to interact with NPCs and the shop.
- press `R` to reload the shotgun.

An unforgivable crime.

A horde of red beans descends upon Ren.
