## Theme: "Self-Augmentation" ## 

The theme for this game jam was self-augmentation. According to merriam-webster, the definition of augmentation is: "to make greater, more numerous, larger, or more intense". 
To stick with that theme, I built a little hack-and-slash game with upgrades using kaboomjs. 

## gameplay ##

- Use the `WASD` to move around, and click to attack. 
- Press `TAB` to switch between sword and shotgun. 
- Collect coins to upgrade your weapons and health. 
- Press `E` to interact with NPCs and the shop.
- press `R` to reload the shotgun.
